The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.\n",

    "## How quicksort works?\n",
    "Like most divide and conquer algorithm, the quicksort algorithm works by applying the following three stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conquer (What is the simplest case that we can directly solve?)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  An array of size <= 1 is already sorted, since it only has at most one element. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Divide (If the current problem is too complex that we cannot solve directly, then divide it into subproblems and try solving them.)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For an array of size larger than 1, we select a pivot (a base element), then divide the array into three parts: [all elements smaller than pivot], [pivot], [all elements greater than pivot]. Then we call quicksort() twice for solving the [all elements smaller than pivot] and [all elements greater than pivot].  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  (Note: there will be multiple ways to deal with cases when the element equal the pivot. In this notebook, we will assume the elements equal to the pivot will be put into the left subarray i.e. [all elements smaller than pivot]).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Merge (If all the subproblems are solved, we should get the right answer for the whole problem by \"merging\" all subproblems.)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Unlike mergesort, in quicksort, if we sort all three divisions (i.e. [all elements smaller than pivot], [pivot], [all elements greater than pivot]) of the whole array, then the whole array is automatically sorted. So NOTHING is needed in this stage."
